# HTTP Firebase Proxy

A node server for easily recording HTTP requests. Requests are stored in Firebase so that they can be viewed in realtime. Useful for debugging REST API calls in production.

Records the request's url, ip, headers, method, body and response's code, headers and body.

```
git clone https://github.com/joshnuss/http-firebase-proxy
```

## Usage

### Start the server

```
FIREBASE_URL=<your-firebase-url> PORT=<port-number> node app.js
```

### Setup a subdomain

The proxy can record of multiple APIs at once. Each API gets its own subdomain.

For example, say you want to debug requests for the API `http://api.openweathermap.org`. If your proxy is on `http://local.dev`, you can set up a mapping for `http://weather.local.dev` to point to `http://api.openweathermap.org`.

To set up the mapping, go to your Firebase URL /mapping, example `https://<my-firebase-id>.firebaseio.com/mappings` and add a record:

```json
{"alias": "weather", "url": "http://api.openweathermap.org"}
```

### Use the proxy

Just replace the domain part of your URL with the proxy's domain:

```
# Use direct service
curl -v http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q=Chicago,IL
```

```
# Same response, but records all calls
curl -v http://weather.local.dev/data/2.5/weather?q=Chicago,IL
```

### View traffic

Check your Firebase dashboard, you will have a `https://<my-firebase-id>.firebaseio.com/weather` and you can watch as requests come in live.
